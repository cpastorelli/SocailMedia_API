# Socical Network API

## Intro 
Soical Network API is a project that is to showcase the use of API calls (being done through Insomnia) to create, modify, and delete both Users and Ideas (Thoughts), as one might see in common social medial outlets similar to Facebook or Twitter. Using Non-relational database MongoDB to store data, we are utilizing that and API calls to build the bulk of the site.
